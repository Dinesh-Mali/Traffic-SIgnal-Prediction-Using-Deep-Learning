# Traffic-SIgnal-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
In this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Network to build train and test a traffic sign classification model. 
We will build this model using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. 
This model can be used to make smarter cars.

This model can be used in self driving cars which will enable them to automatically recognize traffic signs;
similarly the driver alert system inside cars will help and protect drivers by understanding the traffic signs around them.

I haven't provoded data due to large size, So please downlaod dataset from kaggle under: meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.
